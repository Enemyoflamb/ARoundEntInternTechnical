Its preferable to launch the backend first, then the front end.

# Backend:

If the node modules aren't installed yet, then run:
`npm install`
Then just run the backend js file:
`node index.js`

# Frontend

If the node modules aren't installed yet, then run:
`npm install`
Then start the react project:
`npm start`
